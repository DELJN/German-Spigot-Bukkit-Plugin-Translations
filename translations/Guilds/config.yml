        # The way this works is very simple. If you have "console" set to "true", you will see the announcement when the server starts.
        # If you have "in-game" set to "true", your OPed players will see it the first time they login to the server.

    # Choosing your language for the plugin couldn't be easier! The default language is english.
    # If you speak another language but don't see it here, feel free to submit it via one of the links above to have it added to the plugin.
